// bound.
//
// The input path was never the problem. The compositor was. It must take the
// read side of every window's ioMu on every frame, and outputWriter held the
// exclusive side across the whole pending batch. Parsing a 256KiB batch of
// line-heavy output costs tens of milliseconds, sync.RWMutex parks readers
// behind a queued writer, and a bursting pane always has more data waiting, so
// the writer re-queued immediately and the renderer never got in. Frames
// stopped for every pane at once, which is why an echo in an unrelated pane
// never arrived even though the keystroke reached its PTY promptly.
//
// So this measures the property that actually broke: how long the compositor
// waits to read a pane that is bursting. It asserts a bound rather than a
// speedup because the failure was unbounded, and it samples at frame cadence
// because that is when the real renderer asks.
