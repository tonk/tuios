// The tape shows one cell per action and the cell has one glyph, so the
// alphabet has to collapse to a handful of classes. The grouping is by what the
// action is to a user, because that is what the shot is of: a machine doing to
// the multiplexer the things a person does to it, far too fast.
//
// A class covers a set of Kinds explicitly rather than by a range or a prefix.
// A Kind added to the alphabet and left out of every class would otherwise be
// drawn under whichever letter the fallback happened to be, which is a cell
// claiming an action that did not happen. The test in this package asserts the
// classes partition the alphabet, so adding a Kind breaks the build's tests
// rather than the display's truthfulness.

// Class is one row of the mix histogram and one glyph on the tape.
