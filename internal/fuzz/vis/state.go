// The observer half. Everything here runs on the engine's own goroutine, so the
// rule is that no method allocates, blocks, or grows anything: the state is
// fixed-size, written in place, and the renderer copies a snapshot out of it on
// its own cadence. The engine never waits for a frame, and a display that fell
// behind loses frames rather than actions.
//
// One mutex covers it. It is held for the few nanoseconds a counter bump takes
// and never across a render, so it cannot become backpressure. Losing frames is
// fine; losing a violation is not, which is why every failure latches: a rule
// that goes red between two frames is still red at the next one.
