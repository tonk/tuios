// Package vis draws a fuzzing run while it happens.
//
// It attaches to the engine through fuzz.Observer, which hands out what
// happened and takes nothing back, so nothing here can change what the fuzzer
// explores. The determinism gate in internal/fuzz proves that for the seam and
// the gate in this package proves it for the whole display: one seed, drawn and
// undrawn, has to produce the same trace.
//
// The design position is that the truth is the spectacle. Every mark maps to
// something the engine did: a tape cell is one action, a dot is one registered
// invariant, a funnel bar is one shrink candidate at its real length. There is
// no progress bar, because a fuzzer has no denominator; no coverage figure,
// because nothing measures coverage; and no idle animation, because motion on
// this screen means work happened.
