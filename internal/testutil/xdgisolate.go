// test comes far too late to redirect anything: by then xdg.StateHome already
// holds the real ~/.local/state. Redirecting has to happen before the first
// test runs and it has to cover the whole binary, which is what TestMain is
// for. A per-test helper is the wrong shape for this, because the next test
// written is the one that forgets to call it.
