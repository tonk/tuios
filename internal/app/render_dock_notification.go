// The message block that lives in the dock's right-hand end.
//
// The placement is the whole point: a message belongs to the bar and never
// covers a pane. The corner toast this replaces was drawn as a layer on top of
// the workspace, three rows tall, and landed exactly where a freshly split
// pane's first output goes.
//
// The cap and the severity rail both wanted the left cell, so here they are the
// same cell: a partial block flush against the block's dark body, opening it
// the way the dock's own powerline caps open the mode pill, and inked two
// eighths for info and success, four for a warning, six for an error. The
// weight is a channel that survives greyscale and a theme with no contrast to
// spare, which colour alone does not.
//
// That weight is why the body behind the cap is the dark surface and not a
// severity fill. A sliver only reads as a weight against something that is not
// the same colour; against a solid severity field all it changes is where the
// field starts, with nothing to compare it against, and an error stops being
// distinguishable from an info. This design therefore carries less colour than
// a filled pill would, deliberately.
//
// Naming goes to the mark, a Nerd Font severity glyph sitting on the surface in
// the severity colour rather than knocked out of a coloured chip, so the
// message itself is never on a coloured ground and stays as legible as the rest
// of the dock.
//
// Time is carried by the dock's own hairline, one row above: it lights in the
// severity colour across exactly the block's span and burns down from the right
// as the message ages. A sticky error lights it end to end and stops, so "not
// moving" is the affordance that it is waiting for you.

// notifBlock is a rendered message: the dock's right-hand block, and the run of
// hairline that goes above it. They are produced together because the rule's
// length is defined as the block's span, and the two drifting apart is exactly
// the sort of thing that only shows up on screen.
