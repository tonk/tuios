// Agent alerts run on the client, not the daemon, and that is the design rather
// than an accident.
//
// The daemon owns agent state and is where every transition becomes
// authoritative, but three things live only on the client: the terminal an
// in-band notification has to reach, the user config (the daemon reads three
// keys at startup and the in-process daemon under `tuios ssh` reads none), and
// the dock stack whose messages are already clickable. So the client alerts on
// the authoritative transitions it observes through the state sync, which is
// every transition the daemon published.
//
// The consequence is stated rather than hidden: a session with nobody attached
// raises nothing. There is no terminal to write to and no dock to draw on, and
// the escape hatch that would work anyway (a command reaching a phone) is the
// one thing that would need a daemon-side copy of all of the above.

// pendingAgentAlert is an alert waiting out the settle window. Holding the
// window id rather than the pointer means a pane closed during the wait simply
// fails the lookup instead of resurrecting a dead window.
