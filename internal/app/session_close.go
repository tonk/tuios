// appears when something is running is a dialog people learn to dismiss without
// reading, and the one time it carries news is the one time they have already
// stopped looking at it.

// What makes it worth the keystroke is the second line: the panes and the
// agents are counted off live state as the dialog draws, so it says what is
// about to be lost rather than warning in general. An agent mid-task or waiting
// on an answer is called out by name, because that is the case where the user
// either genuinely means it or has just made the mistake this dialog exists to
// catch.
