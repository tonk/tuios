// The capability probe used to cost a fixed half second of every start, and
// the reason was invisible from the outside: it waited for a count of
// terminator bytes, and two of the three replies it asked for never contain
// one. These pin the two properties that fixes it, that the read stops on the
// reply rather than on the clock, and that every answer is still read out of
// the single response that gets.

// probeReply feeds a canned terminal response through a pipe and returns what
// readTTYResponse made of it, and how long it waited. A pipe stands in for the
// tty because readTTYResponse only ever polls and reads a file descriptor.
//
// The write end is held open for the whole read, because a closed one reports
// EOF and would end the read for a reason a real terminal never supplies. That
// is exactly what the backstop case has to avoid being fooled by.
