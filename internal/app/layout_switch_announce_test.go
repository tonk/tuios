// The same rule TestWorkspaceSwitchSendsNoSpuriousWinch pins for a workspace
// switch, stated for a layout-mode switch: a pane whose drawable size the switch
// did not move must not be told a size, and a pane the switch did move must be
// told the settled one exactly once.
//
// A layout switch used to clear every pane's Tiled flag first, which announced a
// bordered box at the rectangle the pane still had, and then place the pane,
// which announced the real one. Re-selecting the mode a workspace was already in
// therefore repainted every full-screen guest on screen twice for nothing.

// switchLayoutMode selects a mode by name through the same entry points the
// keybindings use.
