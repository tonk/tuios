// It fires on a chord tuios recognised anyway, which is deliberate: that is the
// moment it can be certain of the diagnosis, having just had to translate a
// composed glyph back into the chord the user meant. The glyph tables cover the
// characters macOS composes, and nothing can cover a dead key the terminal
// swallows whole (Option+n emits nothing at all until a second key ends the
// composition) or the alt+arrow chords Ghostty rewrites before they are encoded.
// Those keep missing until the setting named here is turned on, so the user is
// told about it the first time the subject comes up rather than left to find out
// which of their bindings are quietly unreliable.
