// TestRenderTerminalDoesNotReenterIOLock is the regression test for the freeze
// that made tuios unusable: the whole UI would wedge at zero CPU within seconds
// of a shell producing output, in both daemon and standalone mode.
//
// renderTerminal takes window.RLockIO() for the duration of its cell walk. It
// then called m.getRealCursor(), which takes the focused window's RLockIO()
// again. When the rendered window is the focused one, that is the same
// sync.RWMutex twice on one goroutine.
//
// A sync.RWMutex is not reentrant for readers. Once a writer calls Lock, every
// subsequent RLock blocks so the writer cannot be starved. So the interleaving
// below is fatal:
//
//	UI goroutine   RLockIO            (read lock held)
//	PTY goroutine  LockIO             (queues, waits for the reader)
//	UI goroutine   RLockIO again      (parks behind the queued writer)
//
// The UI goroutine waits for the writer, the writer waits for the UI
// goroutine's first read lock, and nothing runs again. The PTY writer at
// internal/terminal/window_io.go fires on every chunk of shell output, so the
// interleaving is hit constantly in normal use.
//
// This test drives that race directly: one goroutine renders in a loop while
// another takes and releases the exclusive I/O lock the way the PTY reader
// does. Against the unfixed code it deadlocks and fails on the deadline.
// Against the fixed code the cursor query happens before the lock is taken, the
// two acquisitions never nest, and it completes promptly.

// Deliberately NOT ported to testing/synctest, despite the deadline-based
// failure below looking like exactly what synctest is for. A goroutine blocked
// on a sync.Mutex or sync.RWMutex is not "durably blocked" as synctest defines
// it - only channel operations, select, time.Sleep, WaitGroup.Wait and
// Cond.Wait qualify. A lock-reentry deadlock inside a bubble therefore does not
// trip synctest's deadlock detector; the bubble simply stops making progress
// and the test binary hangs until the package timeout, with a worse diagnostic
// than the explicit deadline here gives.
//
// synctest is the right tool for the sibling tests that assert on goroutine
// lifetime and on lock state sampled with TryLock (see
// internal/terminal/window_goroutine_leak_test.go and
// window_lock_discipline_test.go). It is the wrong tool for a mutex deadlock.
