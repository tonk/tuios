// TestFullscreenFastPathYieldsToShowkeys pins the fix for the keycast lag: the
// fullscreen fast path (buildFullscreenFrame) bypasses the compositor and so
// never draws the showkeys overlay, which is a compositor layer. A lone
// fullscreen window is the common terminal-mode case, so if the fast path stays
// eligible while the overlay has keys, a captured keypress is never rendered
// until an unrelated redraw disqualifies the fast path.
//
// The test builds exactly the geometry fullscreenFastWindow accepts, confirms it
// is eligible with an empty history (nothing to draw, keep the optimization),
// then shows that a single captured keypress makes it ineligible so the frame
// falls through to GetCanvas -> renderOverlays and the keycast is drawn.
