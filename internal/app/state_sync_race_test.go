// TestApplyStateSyncResizeRacesOutput is the regression test for daemon windows
// going blank when focus moves to another pane.
//
// The terminal emulator has no lock of its own. Every other resize path takes
// the window's I/O lock (Window.Resize, ToggleZoom) because the daemon
// outputWriter goroutine writes the cell buffer under that lock and the
// renderer reads it under RLockIO. updateWindowFromState resized the emulator
// without the lock, and ultraviolet's Buffer.Resize reallocates every line, so
// a sync landing mid-write or mid-render tore the buffer and the pane rendered
// as empty cells. renderTerminal then cached that empty render, and an idle
// shell emits nothing to re-dirty it, so the pane stayed blank.
//
// The trigger is a focus change: input.HandleInput calls SyncStateToDaemon
// after any input in a daemon session, the daemon broadcasts the new state
// back, and ApplyStateSync feeds it through updateWindowFromState. The resize
// only runs when the geometry actually changed, which is why it was
// intermittent rather than constant.
//
// This is a race-detector test. It asserts nothing itself and only fails under
// -race, where the unsynchronized buffer access is reported.
//
// Its detection power has been verified rather than assumed: compiled against
// the parent commit b0cd5e9, which lacks the LockIO calls, it fails with a
// reported race on the emulator cell buffer, and it passes with them. Keep it
// that way. If a later refactor makes it pass on unlocked code it has stopped
// guarding anything.
//
// Note for anyone extending this coverage: the black box tuitest scenarios that
// drive a real binary and assert on rendered pane text do NOT have this
// property. A focus-cycling scenario of that kind passes against both the
// locked and unlocked builds, because a torn buffer does not reliably surface
// as missing text within the run. The race detector is the mechanism that
// works here, so express regressions of this class as -race tests.

// daemon's snapshot. It reaches a pane that is already subscribed on two paths:
// the tape-playback re-fetch in updateWindowFromState, and (before the callers
// were reordered) every window created by a state sync, which subscribed first
// and restored afterwards. Either way the outputWriter goroutine is writing the
// same cell buffer, so the restore tore it and painted cells from an older
// frame over live output.
//
// The test drives the restore against live output directly, so it keeps
// guarding the lock even if a later change reorders the callers again. Like the
// tests above it asserts nothing and only fails under -race; verified failing
// against the unlocked code with a race on the emulator cell buffer.

// into a real box on the client, and resizing the emulator to the new box was
// the one resize on this path that did not take the window's I/O lock. By the

// outputWriter goroutine is writing the same cell buffer that Resize is
// reallocating: the symptom is the same permanently blank pane, since a torn
// render is cached and an idle shell never re-dirties it.
//
// The trigger on a real session is pressing n, or any other route that has the
// daemon rather than this client create the window.

// Like the test above this asserts nothing and only fails under -race. Its
// detection power was verified by running it against the unlocked code, where
