// The dock's two session controls, at the bar's right-hand end.
//
// They exist because a multiplexer asks people to hold two ideas apart that
// look the same from the outside: quitting the client while the session keeps
// running, and ending the session and everything in it. Only one of those is
// recoverable.
//
// So they are deliberately not a matched pair. Leaving is the prominent
// control, drawn in the dock's normal text colour and bold. Closing is
// recessed, muted until the pointer is on it, and it always goes through a
// confirmation that names what would die. Two equally weighted buttons an inch
// apart is the layout that produces the misclick, and this misclick cannot be
// taken back.
//
// They sit apart from the workspace strip on purpose: the strip is
// workspace-scoped and these are session-scoped, and the two ended up next to
// each other in an early sketch where "close" read as "close this workspace".

// DockSessionAction names one of the dock's session controls.

// field means "the pointer is on neither".

// Recorded by the renderer for the same reason the minimized entries are: the
// strip's columns depend on the bar's total width and on whether the leave
// control is there at all, and a handler that works that out again is a second
// implementation that can disagree with the frame on screen.

// already carried by the glyphs.

// columns of the bar were being spent restating two icons that never move, on
// the one row where every other element carries a number or a state you cannot
// read anywhere else. The words are still reachable without a pointer: the help
// menu and the which-key sheet name both actions.
