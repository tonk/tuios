// TestResizeSeamStaysClosed holds the seam a resize opens inside the compared
// window, where the matrix's resized-while-producing shape cannot keep it: that
// shape floods tens of thousands of rows to be sure the guest is still talking
// when the resizes land, so the rows laid out around the seam are evicted long
// before the comparison reads either side, and only a width the two copies
// still disagree about at the end can fail it.
//
// Here the guest produces little enough that every row it ever made is still
// held on both sides, and slowly enough that the resizes land among the bytes
// rather than after them. A line laid out at a width the other side never had
// is then a row the comparison reads, not one it lost to eviction. There is no
// route: the two copies are compared live, because a route that rebuilds the
// client's emulator from the daemon's snapshot would hand it the daemon's own
// layout and hide exactly the disagreement this exists to see.
