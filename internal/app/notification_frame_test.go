// TestNotificationKeepsTheFrameDrawing is the regression test for a message
// that never comes down.
//
// Messages expire on a wall-clock timer, and the only thing that retires one is
// CleanupNotifications. That used to run while a frame was being composed, so
// the maintenance tick had no reason to compose a frame just because a message
// was on screen; once the session went quiet - no animation, no PTY output, no
// keystroke - the last frame drawn was served from the render cache
// indefinitely, with whatever message happened to be up still painted over the
// panes underneath it.
//
// This is how a project tape that split a pane and echoed into it could finish
// correctly and still show an empty pane: the tape's own "Trusted ..." toast was
// sitting exactly where the new pane's first lines were, the panes then went
// idle, and no later frame ever replaced that one.
//
// The cap design moved the message into the dock, so it can no longer cover a
// pane, but the coupling it was drawn from would be just as wrong there: the
// hairline under a message burns down per frame, and a message that outlived
// its duration on a cached frame would sit on a rule frozen partway through.
// Expiry now happens on the tick, which is what this pins.
