// panesBorderless reports whether the panes this client is arranging drop their

//
// It is the single answer to a question three parts of the app used to work out
// for themselves from config.SharedBorders alone: which border a pane draws,
// whether a separator is painted between two of them, and how many columns the
// layout keeps free for that separator. The setting is only half of it. Shared
// borders merge nothing unless tiling is arranging the panes, and the scrolling
// layout never merges at all, so a pane under any of those keeps its own box.

// separatorGap is the columns the layout keeps between two neighbouring panes.
//
// Borderless panes need one: their rectangles are guest output from edge to
// edge, and the divider the user sees is an overlay painted in the column
// between them. Panes drawing their own borders need none. Their two adjacent
// border columns already divide them, so a third column would draw nothing,
// and every pane on that side of every split would be a column narrower for it.

// reclaimSeparatorGaps re-lays-out every workspace's panes at the gap the
// layout now reserves, so a column held open for a divider that is no longer
// drawn goes back to the panes beside it instead of sitting empty.
//
// It runs on the toggle itself rather than lazily when a workspace next comes
// into view, for two reasons. Every workspace is still standing in the
// arrangement the tiler gave it at this moment, so redoing its rectangles is
// safe; once tiling is off the user is free to drag those panes about, and
// redoing the layout then would throw that arrangement away. And a workspace
// left holding the gap is the stranding this area has produced before: panes
// drawing their own boxes inside rectangles still spaced for a separator, with
// nobody to settle them but a retile that never runs.
//
// Geometry is applied directly rather than eased into. A pane growing by a
// single column has nothing to travel, and the mode switch it follows is
// structural.
