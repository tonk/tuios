// A pane must draw inside its own rectangle and nowhere else.
//
// The way it stopped doing that: a snap animation, which every retile creates,
// interpolates a window's X, Y, Width and Height on every tick and deliberately
// leaves the emulator alone until the transition ends. So for the length of the
// animation the pane's rectangle is the new one while its body is still the old
// one, and renderTerminal hands back a body sized by the emulator - the
// unfocused fast path returns the emulator's own Render() verbatim.
//
// lipgloss's Width and Height pad but never truncate, so that oversized body
// grew the box: the bottom border landed one or more rows BELOW the pane's own
// bottom edge, on top of the pane beneath it or in the status bar. In a three
// pane layout, one tall pane on the left and two stacked on the right, the
// bottom edges stopped lining up and the left pane's frame ran into the status
// bar.
