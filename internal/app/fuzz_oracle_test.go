// Every rule here is one the suite already pins for a particular arrangement,
// generalised to hold after any action. Where the existing test walks a fixed
// matrix, the rule below is stated without reference to the arrangement, so a

//
// Rules are ordered cheapest first, and Check returns at the first rule that
// breaks. That keeps the common path (nothing is wrong) off the expensive
// render, and it makes the shrinker's job well defined: one failing run names
// one rule.

// several code paths compare it against a stored one, so a run driven by
// time.Now would take a different branch on a slow machine and stop
