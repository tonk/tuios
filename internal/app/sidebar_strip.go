// The collapsed rail is three columns, and what was wrong with it was the space
// its marks sat in rather than the marks. On bare Canvas the strip has no ground
// of its own, so it merges with the glyph margin of whatever agent TUI is
// running in the pane beside it: two columns of small marks three cells apart
// read as one object. The strip is now a full-height Panel band across all three
// columns. Guest margins sit on Canvas, strip marks sit on Panel, and the
// hairline rule stays on the pane-facing column because it is the boundary that
// survives a terminal with no background colour to give.
//
// Inside the band there is one spine: one glyph per session, always the same
// column, at a fixed interval, pinned to the top under the badge. A top-aligned
// single-column list at a fixed interval reads as a list; the old centred stack
// of digits, glyphs and inked cells at irregular intervals read as debris.
//
// Under the spine sits the second list: the agents group, pinned to the bottom
// above the controls and fenced off by a drawn rule. It is the same interval and
// the same two columns as the spine, because one interval is what makes either
// of them scan; what tells them apart is the rule, the anchor, and that every
// mark in the group is a state glyph while the spine at rest is all dots. It
// lists panes, the spine lists sessions, and with nothing running the group is
// absent entirely rather than standing empty.
//
// Severity is inked exactly once, in the badge. A session wanting a human swaps
// its resting dot for its own glyph in its severity colour, which is a mark and
// not a second alarm; two saturated blocks on a three-column strip are
// decoration. Window-count digits are gone everywhere but the badge count: the
// hover tooltip already says "name · N terminals", and the digits were most of
// the mixed vocabulary that stopped the stack reading as one list.
