//
// This is the whole reason the throttle alone is not enough. The state a rule
// most wants to see is a blocking prompt, and a blocking prompt is painted by
// the LAST chunk a pane emits before it goes silent: the throttle can swallow
// exactly that chunk and then nothing else ever arrives to trigger a scan. One
// timer, armed on output and disarmed when it fires, closes that hole without a
// ticker, so a pane that stays silent costs nothing.

// scanScreenForAgent matches the harness's screen rules against the bottom of a
// pane and reports what they say.
//
// It is the last-resort tier and reports as AgentSourceScreen, so it does not
// write over a harness reporting for itself or an escape sequence the pane
// emitted. What it can do is see a state those two never mention: a harness
// sitting on a blocking prompt paints it once and then emits nothing at all, no
// title and no progress sequence, so the screen is the only channel carrying the
// fact that a human is being waited for.
//
// That is also why it carries the one exception to the ranking. A source that
// has gone quiet while the pane painted a prompt over it is stale rather than
// authoritative, so a matched blocker may take its claim; see
// blockerOverridesClaim. The claim goes back the moment a later look finds the
// prompt gone.
//
// It reports whether a rule matched, which is a different question from whether
// the report was accepted: a matching rule means the screen carries an answer
// even when a higher-ranked source owns the window, and the silence timer needs
// that fact to know it must not call the pane idle.
