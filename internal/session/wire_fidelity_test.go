// The wire's fidelity, asked about directly.

// TestRehydrationMatrix in internal/app compares the two sides by reading the
// daemon's through this wire, so it can only ever see what the wire can say. A
// snapshot that restores a pane's characters while losing what colour they were
// passes every case in it and is obviously wrong on screen, which is the shape
// of the bugs it was still leaving behind.
//
// This test asks the question the other way round: feed a guest's output to one
// emulator, take it through TerminalStateOf and ApplyTerminalState into a
// second, and compare the two emulators to each other. Anything the wire cannot
// carry shows up here as a difference between the two, with no wire in the
// middle of the comparison to hide it.
