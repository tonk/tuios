// Resizing one divider changes the rectangle every split below it is laid out
// in. Those splits were not dragged, so their proportions have to survive the
// change: a nested pair that was even stays even as the region it lives in
// grows or shrinks, and a drag that returns to where it began leaves the whole
// layout where it began.
//
// The failure this pins is not a single wrong frame. Every path that changes
// geometry without going through the tree asks for a ratio sync, and the sync
// re-derives every split in the tree from integer geometry. Integer geometry
// cannot represent most ratios, so each pass rounds the ratio towards the cell
// boundary below it, and the loss is in the same direction every time. Over one
// drag that is dozens of passes, and the nested pair walks off centre and stays
// there.

// ratioOS is the maintainer's layout: a full-width pane across the top, and
// below it a left pane beside a right column split into two. Dragging the
// divider under the top pane resizes the lower region, which is the parent of
// the nested pair nobody touched.
