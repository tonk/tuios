// multiClickInterval is how long after a click a second one still counts as
// part of the same gesture, and therefore how long a multi-click selection's
// clipboard write waits before it can be trusted.
//
// It was 500ms, matching the Windows and macOS defaults, back when it only
// decided how a click sequence was read. Now that it also gates the clipboard
// it is a delay the user waits through, and half a second is past the point
// where a response stops feeling immediate: the usual figure for that is
// around 300ms, beyond which an interface reads as reacting rather than
// responding.
//
// 300ms is chosen against both ends. Below it: measured inter-click intervals
// for an unhurried double-click sit around 100-250ms, and xterm has shipped a
// 250ms multiClickTime for decades without being thought broken, so 300ms
// still admits a comfortably slow double-click. Above it: GTK and Qt both
// default to 400ms, which would work but spends another tenth of a second on
// every copy. The cost of being wrong is asymmetric but small either way, a
// deliberate triple-click read as a double plus a single, and the user can see
// what got selected before it lands.

// multiClickSlop is how far the pointer may drift between clicks of one
