// A wheel click is a viewport gesture, not a cursor motion.
//
// These helpers move CopyMode.ScrollOffset directly, the way Shift+Up/Down
// already did. The wheel used to drive the k/j motions instead, and those keep
// the cursor near the middle of the pane and only scroll once it gets there:
// deliberate for keyboard navigation, and wrong for a wheel. With the cursor
// down at the shell prompt, where it lands after the previous gesture scrolled
// back to the bottom or after a click, every iteration only decremented CursorY
// and the view did not move at all. On a 40-row pane that is around twenty dead
// iterations, several whole wheel clicks of nothing happening before the first
// line moved. moveUp/moveDown are untouched, so k and j still behave as before.
//
// The cursor follows the text under it rather than the screen row it sits on:
// CursorY is viewport-relative and absolute position is
// scrollbackLen-ScrollOffset+CursorY, so a scroll that did not move the cursor
// would silently slide it onto different content. Following keeps a v pressed
// after a scroll selecting from the line the user was looking at, and keeps an
// in-progress visual selection anchored to its text. It is clamped to the
// visible rows on every step, so the cursor can never end up outside the region
// being drawn: once the line it was on scrolls past an edge, the cursor rides
// that edge.

// scrollback, so the session that existed only to render it goes away. It goes
// quietly, because there was nothing to announce on the way in either.
//
// An explicit session is left alone. The wheel used to throw the user out of
// copy mode they had asked for, once the cursor happened to reach the last row,
// which is a surprise in the other direction; q and Esc still exit, and both
// already return the pane to the bottom.

// auto-scrolls, and exiting at zero would drop the drag mid-gesture.
