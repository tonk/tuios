// runContextMenuAction dispatches an action chosen from a context menu.
//
// It goes through the same ActionDispatcher that every keybinding goes through,
// which is the point: a menu row carries an action ID and nothing else, so it
// runs exactly the code the key runs. A menu that held its own copy of the
// behaviour would drift from the keybinding the moment either side changed, and
// there is already one popup in this codebase describing keys from a
// hand-written table rather than from the registry.
//
// An empty action means the click landed on the menu but not on a runnable row,
// or that the menu was dismissed; either way nothing runs.
//
// The zero KeyPressMsg is deliberate. Dispatch passes it to the handler, and no
// action reachable from a context menu reads the originating key: the handlers
// that do take their argument are the number-key window selectors, which no
// menu offers.

// handleContextMenuKey drives an open context menu from the keyboard: arrows or
// j/k move the selection, enter runs it, escape closes without running
