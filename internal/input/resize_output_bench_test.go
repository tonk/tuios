// every motion event has its render skipped and View returns cached content,

// clears renderSkipped, so a single byte of output anywhere forces the next
// View to compose for real. One motion event plus one PTY wakeup per iteration
// is one composed frame per iteration, which is the unit that decides whether a

// of the frame was invisible to a benchmark's nil daemon callback.

// A resize is direct manipulation. The edge belongs to the pointer and follows
// it cell for cell, with nothing easing toward it. The shared
// border ratio sync used to reapply the whole BSP layout on every composed
// frame, and that path builds a snap animation per window, each easing over
// 300ms toward a target the next frame would replace. The animations were
// discarded and rebuilt roughly every frame, so the panes never arrived at
// anything; they trailed the cursor on a curve that restarted continuously.
// That reads as mush, and it costs almost no CPU time, which is why it hid from
// every benchmark. It was shared-borders-only because only that mode reapplies
// the layout from the sync, which matches where the slowness was reported.
//
// Ticks are delivered here because animations advance on the tick, so a test
// that only sends motion would never see one move a window.
