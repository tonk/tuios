// interaction frame budget, which is the property that stops a fast drag from
// building a render backlog. And the frame after release must show the geometry
// of the last pointer position: coalescing that dropped the final event would
// leave the layout settled somewhere other than where the user let go.
//
// The frame bound is stated as a rate rather than as "some event was skipped"
