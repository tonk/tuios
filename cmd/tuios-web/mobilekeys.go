// mobileCommands are the commands the chord row offers, left to right.
//
// Each is named by its registry action rather than by its key, so a user who
// rebinds one gets a button that sends what they bound. The set is the work a
// phone actually does: make a window, get rid of it, move between them, change
// how they are laid out, and reach the two overlays that hold everything else.
//
// The order is the design. Eleven buttons and the latch are 620px of strip
// against the 331px a 390px phone has, so the row pans and the first seven are
// what a thumb sees on arrival. They are the seven a thumb wants: make and
// close a pane, move between them, zoom, which is the only way a second pane is
// usable on a screen this narrow, and the command palette, which is the way to
// everything that did not fit. The layout commands and the two overlays are
// behind a pan, which is the right place for what a phone reaches for once a
// session rather than once a minute.
