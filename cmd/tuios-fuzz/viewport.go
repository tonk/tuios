// The model is not safe to render from a second goroutine, so the display never
// reaches into it. Instead the display raises a flag saying it would like a
// frame, and the next action to execute takes one on the engine's own goroutine
// and publishes it. The display then draws whatever was last published.
//
// That costs one render per drawn frame rather than one per action, and it
// cannot race: every read of the model happens between two actions, on the
// goroutine that owns it. When the display is off none of this is installed.

// watched is a target that publishes the app's frame when the display asks.
