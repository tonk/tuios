// The other end of the fuzzer: the same action alphabet, replayed against a real
// tuios in a real PTY with a real daemon behind it.
//
// It used to be the weaker oracle, and it used to boot the binary with no
// arguments, which is the standalone TUI (cmd/tuios/main.go RunE -> runLocal).
// That target had no daemon at all, so the half of tuios this file exists to
// cover was not being covered: every finding it could produce was one the
// in-process target could produce faster. It now attaches to a real session, and
// the oracle asks the daemon what it holds rather than asking the client whether
// it agrees with itself. See daemon_witness_test.go for why that distinction is
// the whole point.
//
// The in-process target still owns everything that can be read off the model:
// hit rectangles, announced pane sizes, layout geometry. Duplicating those here
// against a screen scrape would be slower and less certain about the same
// property. What lives here is what only exists once a socket is involved.
//
// Runs are short and shrinking is off by default. A replay costs a full tuios
// boot plus a daemon plus its shells, so the minimisation that takes seconds in
// process takes minutes here; a PTY finding is reproduced with its script and
// then narrowed in process when the class allows it.
