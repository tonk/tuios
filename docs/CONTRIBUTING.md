## Making Changes

### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues** to see if someone is already working on it
2. **Open an issue** to discuss major changes before implementing
3. **Fork the repository** and create a new branch for your changes

### Code Guidelines

- Follow standard Go conventions ([Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go))
- Run `go fmt` before committing
- Ensure tests pass: `go test ./...`
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Write clear commit messages

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create a branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** and commit:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   ```

3. **Test thoroughly** across platforms if possible (see [Testing](#testing) below)

4. **Push and create a PR**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feat/your-feature-name
   ```
   Then open a pull request using the [PR template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/pull_request_template.md)

5. **Fill out the PR template** with:
   - What the PR does
   - Motivation/context
   - Key changes
   - How to verify
   - Platform(s) tested
   - Installation method tested

### Commit Message Format

Use conventional commit prefixes:
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat: add configurable dockbar position
fix: panic when closing last window on Linux
docs: update keybindings reference
```

## Testing

### Cross-Platform Testing

TUIOS supports multiple platforms. If possible, test your changes on:

**Platforms:**
- Linux (x86_64, arm64, armv6, armv7, i386)
- macOS / Darwin (arm64, x86_64)
- FreeBSD (x86_64, arm64, i386)
- Windows (x86_64, i386)

**Installation Methods:**
- Build from source (`go build`)
- Homebrew (macOS/Linux)
- AUR (Arch Linux)
- Nix
- Docker
- Bash install script

**You don't need to test everything** - but mention what you tested in your PR.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run specific package tests
go test ./internal/config/...
```

### Manual Testing Checklist

When testing UI/UX changes:
- [ ] Create/close multiple windows
- [ ] Switch between workspaces
- [ ] Test tiling mode
- [ ] Test copy mode navigation
- [ ] Verify keybindings work as expected
- [ ] Check terminal output rendering
- [ ] Test mouse interactions
