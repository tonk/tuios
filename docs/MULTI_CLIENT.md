# Multi-Client Sessions

TUIOS supports multiple clients connecting to the same session simultaneously, enabling collaborative workflows and flexible access patterns.

> **Note:** Throughout this document, `Ctrl+B` refers to the default leader key. This is configurable via the `leader_key` option in your config file.

## What is Multi-Client Mode?

Multi-client mode allows multiple terminal instances (SSH, web, or local TUI clients) to attach to the same TUIOS session concurrently. All clients see the same windows, input, and output in real-time.

## Use Cases

### Pair Programming
```bash
# Developer A creates and attaches to session
developer-a$ tuios attach pairing-session

# Developer B joins the same session
developer-b$ ssh remote-server
remote$ tuios attach pairing-session
```

Both developers see identical terminal output and can take turns typing.

### Remote Troubleshooting
```bash
# User shares their session
user$ tuios attach support-session

# Support engineer connects
support$ tuios attach support-session
```

The support engineer sees exactly what the user sees and can provide guidance or take control.

### Multi-Device Workflow
```bash
# Work laptop
laptop$ tuios attach dev-work

# Later, from home desktop
desktop$ ssh work-server
work-server$ tuios attach dev-work
```

Seamlessly resume the same session from different devices.

### Screen Sharing / Presentation
```bash
# Presenter
presenter$ tuios attach demo

# Multiple viewers (via SSH or web)
viewer1$ tuios attach demo
viewer2$ tuios-web  # Navigate to session "demo" in browser
```

## How It Works

### Session State Synchronization

When multiple clients attach to a session:

1. **Shared PTY ownership:** Daemon owns the PTYs, not individual clients
2. **Input broadcast:** Any client's input is written to the PTY
3. **Output fanout:** PTY output is broadcast to all attached clients
4. **State sync:** Window positions, focus, workspaces sync across clients

### Terminal Size Coordination

To handle different client terminal sizes, TUIOS uses the **minimum size** strategy:

```
Client A: 120x30 (wide monitor)
Client B: 80x24  (laptop)
Client C: 100x40 (desktop)

Effective size: min(120, 80, 100) x min(30, 24, 40) = 80x24
```

All clients render at the smallest common size. When a client disconnects, the size recalculates based on remaining clients.

**Why minimum size?**
- Prevents content being cut off for smaller terminals
- Ensures all clients see the same content
- Alternative (maximum size) would cause scrolling/wrapping differences

### Client Join/Leave Events

The daemon tracks client connections and notifies sessions:

```
15:32:01 Client A attached (80x24)
15:32:15 Client B attached (120x30) - resizing to 80x24
15:34:22 Client A detached - resizing to 120x30
```

## Commands

### List Sessions
```bash
tuios ls
```

Output:
```
Available sessions:
  - dev-work (2 clients, 4 windows, created 2 hours ago)
  - pairing-session (1 client, 1 window, created 15 minutes ago)
```

### Attach to Session
```bash
# Create if missing
tuios attach my-session

# Attach to existing (fail if doesn't exist)
tuios attach my-session --no-create
```

### Detach from Session
```
Ctrl+B, d  # Default prefix key
```

Or programmatically from another terminal:
```bash
# Send detach key combo to the session
tuios send-keys --session my-session "ctrl+b" "d"
```

### Kill Session
```bash
# Kill specific session
tuios kill my-session

# Kill all sessions
tuios kill-server
```

## Multi-Client Scenarios

### Scenario 1: SSH + Local TUI

```bash
# Terminal 1 (local)
# Note: daemon starts automatically with 'tuios new' or 'tuios attach'
local$ tuios new dev
# Or attach to existing session (creates if doesn't exist):
# local$ tuios attach dev

# Terminal 2 (SSH from remote)
remote$ ssh myserver
myserver$ tuios attach dev
```

Both terminals share the same session.

### Scenario 2: Web + SSH

```bash
# SSH client
ssh$ tuios attach web-demo

# Browser
https://myserver:8080
# Select "web-demo" from session list
```

### Scenario 3: Three Simultaneous Clients

```bash
# Client 1 (local TUI)
local$ tuios attach collab

# Client 2 (SSH)
ssh$ tuios attach collab

# Client 3 (web)
web: Connect to "collab" session
```

All three clients share input/output. If Client 1 runs `ls`, all three see the output.

## Technical Details

### State Synchronization

The daemon sends these update messages to all clients:

- `WindowsUpdate`: Window list changed
- `FocusUpdate`: Active window changed
- `WorkspaceUpdate`: Workspace switched
- `ResizeUpdate`: Effective terminal size changed
- `PTYOutput`: Output from PTY

### Input Handling

- Clients send input via `MsgInput` protocol messages
- Daemon writes input to PTY
- PTY echoes back (normal terminal behavior)
- All clients receive echoed output

### Conflict Resolution

**What happens when multiple clients type simultaneously?**

Characters interleave at the PTY level (standard Unix behavior):
```
Client A types: "hello"
Client B types: "world"
PTY receives:   "hweolrllod" (interleaved)
```

**Best practice:** Coordinate who has "keyboard control" via communication (voice, chat, etc.).

### Performance Considerations

- **Bandwidth:** Each client receives full PTY output (no deduplication)
- **Latency:** Input from any client has same latency as single-client mode
- **Scalability:** Tested with up to 10 simultaneous clients
- **CPU:** Daemon uses select/epoll for efficient multi-client I/O

## Configuration

Multi-client mode is enabled by default when using daemon mode. No special configuration required.

### Disable Multi-Client (force single client)

Not currently supported. To prevent multiple connections, use external access controls (SSH configuration, firewall rules, etc.).

## Security Implications

### Trust Model

By default, every client attached to a session has **full control**:
- Can view all output
- Can send input (keystrokes)
- Can manipulate windows

**Use multi-client mode only with trusted collaborators**, or attach the ones
you don't fully trust with `--read-only` (see below).

## Read-Only Clients

`tuios attach --read-only` and `tuios ssh --read-only` attach a client as a
viewer: it still receives every window's output, but the daemon refuses
anything that would mutate the shared session -

- keyboard and mouse input
- creating, closing, or renaming a window
- resizing or retiling a pane
- pushing layout/state changes
- killing the session

The refusal is enforced by the daemon (`connState.readOnly`), not just the
client - a modified or scripted client attached read-only cannot get around
it. The client also skips sending most of the above itself (no pointless
round trip) and shows a `view-only` badge in its own dock, but that's a
courtesy on top of the server-side gate, not the gate itself.

`--read-only` on `tuios attach` applies to that one client only; every other
client attached to the same session keeps whatever access it attached with.
`--read-only` on `tuios ssh`, by contrast, applies to the whole server: every
SSH connection it accepts is a viewer, with no per-connection exception (SSH
has no concept today of "this remote user gets read-write, that one doesn't").

```bash
# Watch a colleague's session without being able to type into it
tuios attach mysession --read-only

# Every SSH connection is a view-only spectator
tuios ssh --read-only
```

### Authentication

- **Local clients:** Unix socket permissions (same user)
- **SSH clients:** SSH authentication
- **Web clients:** Currently no authentication (TODO for production use)

### Audit Trail

Enable daemon logging to track client connections:
```bash
# Run daemon in foreground with debug logging
tuios daemon --log-level=messages

# Or set log level when creating a session
# (daemon starts automatically in background)
tuios new mysession --log-level=messages
```

Available log levels: `off`, `errors`, `basic`, `messages`, `verbose`, `trace`

Log format:
```
2025-12-25 15:32:01 [INFO] Client connected: id=abc123, addr=192.168.1.100
2025-12-25 15:32:01 [INFO] Client attached to session 'dev-work'
2025-12-25 15:34:22 [INFO] Client detached: id=abc123
```

## Troubleshooting

### Terminal size flickering

**Cause:** Clients with very different terminal sizes joining/leaving

**Solution:** Use terminals of similar size, or resize smaller clients to match

### Input lag with many clients

**Cause:** Network latency or bandwidth saturation

**Solution:**
- Reduce number of simultaneous clients
- Use SSH compression: `ssh -C`
- Check network conditions

### Client sees garbled output

**Cause:** Terminal size mismatch or encoding issues

**Solution:**
- Detach and reattach: `Ctrl+B, d` then `tuios attach <session>`
- Check locale settings: `echo $LANG` (should match across clients)

### Session not visible in list

**Cause:** Session on different daemon, or daemon not running

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if daemon is running and list all sessions
tuios ls

# Verify daemon is running by checking for sessions
# (if no error, daemon is running)
tuios list-windows --json 2>&1 | grep -q "success" && echo "Daemon running" || echo "Daemon not running"
```
