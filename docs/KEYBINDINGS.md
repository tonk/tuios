## Modes

TUIOS has two main modes:

- **Window Management Mode** - Navigate and manage windows (default on startup)
- **Terminal Mode** - Input goes directly to the focused terminal

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `i` or `Enter` | Enter Terminal Mode |
| `Ctrl+B` then `d` or `Esc` | Return to Window Management Mode (from Terminal Mode) |
| `?` (Window Mode) or `Ctrl+B ?` (universal) | Toggle help overlay |
| `q` (Window Mode) or `Ctrl+B q` (universal) | Quit TUIOS |

### Terminal Mode Keys

These work while typing into a pane, without the leader key. They live in `[keybindings.terminal_mode]`.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Alt+N` / `Alt+P` | Next / previous window |
| `Alt+Esc` | Leave Terminal Mode |
| `Alt+←` `Alt+→` `Alt+↑` `Alt+↓` | Focus the pane in that direction |
| `Alt+-` | Split the focused pane horizontally (top/bottom) |
| `Alt+\|` or `Alt+\` | Split the focused pane vertically (left/right) |
| `Alt+S` | Toggle sidebar |
| `Alt+M` | Toggle mouse mode |

Focus moves to the nearest pane whose facing edge lies in that direction and whose span overlaps the current pane's; ties go to the earlier pane. At the edge of the layout nothing happens, and focus does not wrap.

#### Alt+← / Alt+→ conflict with your shell

In readline, fish and zsh, `Alt+←` and `Alt+→` move the cursor one word at a time, which is one of the most-used shell editing bindings there is. TUIOS binds them to pane focus by default, as zellij and most tiling window managers do. Each direction is a separate action, so hand back whichever you want:

```toml
[keybindings.terminal_mode]
terminal_focus_left = []
terminal_focus_right = []
```

With those unbound, the keys reach the shell unchanged. `Alt+↑` and `Alt+↓` are unclaimed by the common shells, so they are the safer pair to keep. If you would rather keep word movement and still have directional focus, put it on a chord the shell does not want:

```toml
[keybindings.terminal_mode]
terminal_focus_left = ["alt+shift+left"]
terminal_focus_right = ["alt+shift+right"]
```

## Sidebar

The sidebar (the rail) is a keyboard scope: while it is focused it owns every key, so its bindings live in their own `[keybindings.sidebar]` section and never fire on a pane.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `s` (Window Mode) or `Ctrl+B e` (universal) | Focus the rail, or leave it |
| `?` (in the rail) | Open the help overlay on the rail's section |
| `Esc` (in the rail) | Leave the rail, back to the mode and pane you came from |

The rail's remaining keys are listed by that help overlay, which reads them from your configuration, so it stays correct when you rebind them. `Esc` always leaves the rail even when the section binds nothing.

## Window Management

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `z` | Toggle zoom (fullscreen focused window) |
| `n` | Create new window |
| `w` or `x` | Close focused window |
| `r` | Rename focused window |
| `m` | Minimize focused window |
| `c` | Copy the focused pane's selection to the clipboard |
| `Shift+M` | Restore all minimized windows |
| `Tab` | Focus next window |
| `Shift+Tab` | Focus previous window |
| `1-9` (Window Mode) or `Alt+1` through `Alt+9` (works anywhere, also while typing) | Select window by number |
| `Alt+\`` (works anywhere, also while typing) | Toggle to the last focused window, and back again on a second press |
| `Shift+1-9` or `!@#$%^&*(` | Restore minimized window by number |
| `Alt+S` | Toggle sidebar (works without the prefix; also `Ctrl+B` `b`) |
| `Alt+M` | Toggle mouse mode (works without the prefix; also `Ctrl+B` `Shift+M`) |

**macOS:** Use `Option+1` through `Option+9`, and `Option+\`` for the last-window toggle (automatically configured by default)

## Workspaces

TUIOS supports 9 workspaces for organizing windows.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Ctrl+B` `1-9` | Switch to workspace 1-9 |
| `Alt+Shift+1` through `Alt+Shift+9` | Move window to workspace and follow |

**macOS:** Use `Option+Shift+1` through `Option+Shift+9` for move-and-follow (automatically configured by default)

## Window Layout

### Manual Snapping (Non-Tiling Mode)

#### Keyboard Snapping

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `h` | Snap window to left half |
| `l` | Snap window to right half |
| `f` | Fullscreen window |
| `u` | Unsnap/restore window |
| `1` | Snap to top-left corner |
| `2` | Snap to top-right corner |
| `3` | Snap to bottom-left corner |
| `4` | Snap to bottom-right corner |

#### Mouse Edge Snapping

In floating mode (non-tiling), drag a window to the screen edges to snap it:

| Edge | Action |
|------|--------|
| Top center | Fullscreen |
| Left edge | Snap to left half |
| Right edge | Snap to right half |
| Top-left corner | Snap to top-left quarter |
| Top-right corner | Snap to top-right quarter |
| Bottom-left corner | Snap to bottom-left quarter |
| Bottom-right corner | Snap to bottom-right quarter |

The edge detection zone is 5 pixels from the screen edge. Simply drag a window by its title bar and release when the cursor reaches the desired edge.

### Tiling Mode

TUIOS uses Binary Space Partitioning (BSP) for automatic tiling. Windows are arranged in an alternating vertical/horizontal split pattern (spiral layout).

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `t` | Toggle automatic tiling mode |
| `Shift+H` or `Ctrl+Left` | Swap with window to the left |
| `Shift+L` or `Ctrl+Right` | Swap with window to the right |
| `Shift+K` or `Ctrl+Up` | Swap with window above |
| `Shift+J` or `Ctrl+Down` | Swap with window below |
| `<` or `Shift+,` | Decrease master window width (from right edge) |
| `>` or `Shift+.` | Increase master window width (from right edge) |
| `{` or `Shift+[` | Decrease focused window height (from bottom edge) |
| `}` or `Shift+]` | Increase focused window height (from bottom edge) |
| `,` | Decrease master window width (from left edge) |
| `.` | Increase master window width (from left edge) |
| `[` | Decrease focused window height (from top edge) |
| `]` | Increase focused window height (from top edge) |

### BSP Split Controls

These commands are available in tiling mode via the prefix key. In terminal mode they are also bound directly as `Alt+-` / `Alt+|` (see [Terminal Mode Keys](#terminal-mode-keys)), so a fullscreen pane can be split without leaving the shell.

| Key Sequence | Action |
|--------------|--------|
| `Ctrl+B` `-` | Split focused window horizontally (top/bottom) |
| `Ctrl+B` `\|` or `\` | Split focused window vertically (left/right) |
| `Ctrl+B` `R` | Rotate split direction at focused window |
| `Ctrl+B` `=` | Equalize all splits (reset to 50/50 ratios) |

The dock shows the next split direction (V for vertical, H for horizontal) when tiling mode is active.

### BSP Preselection

Control where the next window spawns relative to the focused window:

| Key Sequence | Action |
|--------------|--------|
| `Alt+h` | Next window appears left of focused |
| `Alt+l` | Next window appears right of focused |
| `Alt+k` | Next window appears above focused |
| `Alt+j` | Next window appears below focused |

After preselecting a direction, create a new window with `n` or `Ctrl+B` `c`. The preselection is consumed after one window creation.

**Note**: Preselection only works when tiling mode is enabled (press `t` to enable).

**Use Case**: Creating asymmetric layouts (sidebars, specific window placement).

## Copy Mode

Enter copy mode with `Ctrl+B` `[` to navigate scrollback and select text using vim-style commands.

### Basic Navigation

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Ctrl+B` `[` | Enter copy mode |
| `h` `j` `k` `l` | Move cursor left/down/up/right |

| `G` | Jump to bottom (live output) |
| `{number}G` | Jump to line number (e.g., `10G`) |
| `{` `}` | Jump to previous/next paragraph |
| `Ctrl+U` `Ctrl+D` | Half page up/down |
| `Ctrl+B` `Ctrl+F` | Full page up/down |

|--------------|--------|
| `Ctrl+B` `L` `l` | Load layout template |
| `Ctrl+B` `L` `s` | Save layout template |
| `Ctrl+B` `L` `Esc` | Cancel |

Layout loading is non-destructive: existing windows are repositioned to match the template rather than being killed. Extra windows are minimized.

### Debug Prefix (`Ctrl+B` `D`)

Access debug and development tools:

| Key Sequence | Action |
|--------------|--------|
| `Ctrl+B` `D` `l` | Toggle log viewer |
| `Ctrl+B` `D` `c` | Toggle cache statistics |
| `Ctrl+B` `D` `k` | Toggle showkeys overlay |
| `Ctrl+B` `D` `a` | Toggle animations |

**Log Viewer Keys:**
- `q`, `Esc` - Exit log viewer
- `j`, `k`, `↑`, `↓` - Scroll up/down one line
- `Ctrl+U`, `Ctrl+D`, `PgUp`, `PgDn` - Scroll half page
- `g`, `Home` - Go to top
- `G`, `End` - Go to bottom

**Cache Statistics Keys:**
- `q`, `Esc`, `c` - Exit cache stats viewer
- `r` - Reset cache statistics

## Mouse Controls

- **Mouse Wheel**: Scroll the pane's scrollback (when no mouse tracking, not alt screen). No mode is entered and nothing is announced; scrolling back to the bottom returns to live output, and so does typing.
- **Left Drag in a pane**: Select text. Releasing copies it (`copy_on_select`, on by default)
- **Double Click**: Select the word under the pointer (`word_characters` decides what a word is)
- **Triple Click**: Select the whole line. The highlight is immediate, but a multi-click copies about a third of a second after the last click, so a triple-click never puts the word on the clipboard on its way to the line
- **Left Drag Above/Below a pane**: Continues the selection and scrolls
- **Left Click**: Focus window. On a pane's content in window management mode it also enters terminal mode, so the pane is ready to type in. Set `click_to_type = "double"` under `[appearance]` to need two clicks for that, or `"off"` to keep the click to focusing alone
- **Left Drag on the title bar**: Move window (non-tiling) or swap windows (tiling). In window management mode the whole window is a drag handle
- **Right Drag**: Resize window (non-tiling only)
- **Alt+Left Drag**: Move the window, from anywhere on it, including while you are typing in it. This is the usual desktop window-manager gesture, and it is what a plain left drag over a pane's content cannot be, since that selects text. Typing resumes in the pane when the window lands. Set `alt_drag = false` under `[appearance]` to hand the gesture back to the pane
- **Ctrl+Left Drag**: Also moves the window, and drops it as soon as Ctrl is released. Kept alongside Alt+Left Drag; use whichever your hands know
- **Alt+Right Drag**: Resize the window from the nearest corner. The same as Right Drag, except it never opens the context menu, so a short drag cannot turn into a menu by accident
- **Shift+Right Click**: Open the context menu for whatever is under the pointer
- **Title Bar Buttons**: Minimize, maximize, or close window
- **Click Dock Item**: Restore minimized window
- **Copy Mode Click**: Move cursor to position
- **Right Border Click**: Scrollbar jump
- **Right Border Drag**: Scrollbar scroll

Panes running an application that asked for the mouse (vim, less, htop) receive
every one of these events themselves; tuios does not interpret them. Alt+Left
Drag and Ctrl+Left Drag are the two exceptions, so a pane can always be moved
without first leaving the app inside it. `alt_drag = false` gives Alt+Left Drag
back to such an app.

### Context Menus

Shift+right-click opens a short menu of the actions that make sense for what is
under the pointer. Each row shows the key currently bound to the same action, so
the menu doubles as a reminder of the keyboard; rebinding an action changes what
the menu shows.

| Target | Offers |
|--------|--------|
| A pane, anywhere on it | Copy selection, paste, split right, split down, rename, zoom, minimize, close |
| Dock entry | Restore that window, restore all |
| Dock background | New window, toggle tiling, restore all |
| Empty desktop | New window, toggle tiling, command palette, settings, help |

A pane is one target. Its border rows are part of it, so the whole surface of a
pane opens the same menu and there is nothing to aim at.

Arrow keys or `j`/`k` move the selection, `Enter` runs it, `Esc` closes. Moving
the pointer over the menu highlights the row under it. Clicking away from the
menu closes it without running anything. An action that has nothing to act on
right now (copy with no selection, split with tiling off) is shown greyed out
and is skipped by the arrow keys, so the menu keeps the same shape whether or
not the action is available. On a screen too short to show every row, the menu
scrolls with the selection rather than drawing past the bottom edge.

Plain right-click still resizes a window; the menu is on the shift chord so it
takes nothing away.

## Customization

All keybindings can be customized in the configuration file. See the [Configuration Guide](CONFIGURATION.md) for details.

### Quick Customization

```bash
# Edit your keybindings
tuios config edit

# View current configuration
tuios keybinds list

# View only your customizations
tuios keybinds list-custom
```

## Platform-Specific Notes

### macOS

Default window selection and move-and-follow use the Option key:
- `Option+1` through `Option+9` - Select window by number
- `Option+\`` - Toggle to the last focused window
- `Option+Shift+1` through `Option+Shift+9` - Move window to workspace and follow

In your terminal, you can still type Option key unicode characters (¡™£¢∞§¶•ª) in Terminal Mode.

### Linux

Uses standard Alt key for window selection and move-and-follow:
- `Alt+1` through `Alt+9`
- `Alt+Shift+1` through `Alt+Shift+9`
